NativeScript allows scaffolding projects with various templates to kickstart your app development. Official templates can be found in the Templates GitHub repository and on NPM?
Some of the templates are listed in the NativeScript CLI when creating a new project with ns create, others may be used by passing the --template flag with the template name (NPM package name).
